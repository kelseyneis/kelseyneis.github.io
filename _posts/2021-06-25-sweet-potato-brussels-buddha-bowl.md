2. Add the chickpeas to a bowl and toss with olive oil and seasonings. Spread the beans on a small baking sheet and set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 400F and chop all of your veggies. Place the sliced kale in a medim bowl and set aside. Chop your sweet potatoes and burssels and combine in a bowl and top with coconut oil.
4. Spread the sweet potatoes and brussels on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes. 
5. Meanwhile comine 1 cup quinoa with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until water is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Add the hot quinoa to the bowl with the quinoa to let the kale cook a little.
6. Stir the sweet potatoes after 15 minutes in the oven and add the chickpeas to the oven. Cook for another 10-12 minutes, stirring the chickpeas halfway through as well.
7. While the veggies and chickpeas are roasting, make the tahini sauce. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix until smooth or use a blender or food processor!

### Vegetables
-	1 medium-size onion or 2 shallots, minced or diced small
-	8 oz brown mushrooms, sliced and diced
-	1 medium-size carrot, sliced in half moons or grated
-	2 celery stalks, minced
-	1-2 medium-size zucchini or yellow squash, diced
- 2 cups vegetarian stock (I tried 2 cups of boiling water with 2 teaspoons of no-chicken base better than bouillon) 
- 1 tablespoon oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Farro
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¾-1 cup farro
- 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
- 1/3-1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 tsp tomato paste, mixed with 1 tsp water

### Toppings
- 2 tbsp sliced green onions or chives
- fresh parsley

### Method
1. First, rinse the farro in cold water and place in a large bowl covered with warm water and let it sit for 20-30 minutes. 
2. Mise en place: group your ingredients before beginning to cook. Place minced onions bowls, divided, garlic, celery and carrots in another, mushrooms and squash in another and so on. 
3. In a large pan heat some oil and lightly fry half of the onions. After a couple minutes add the mushrooms, celery, carrots and squash and sauté for another 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.
4. In a dutch oven or heavy pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil and add the other half of the onions, and garlic. Sauté for about 2 minutes until fragrant and then add the parsley, and farro.
5. Mix well and add the white wine (or ginger kombucha), 1/3 cup of the vegetable stock and the tomato paste. Keep stirring and cooking until the liquid almost evaporates and then add more. Repeat until you use up the rest of the vegetable stock. Now, you can keep adding small amounts of water until you reach the desired tenderness and consistency. Cook the farro for about a half hour, but be careful not to overcook it. The farro should be tender but firm to the bite. The liquid should be creamy in consistency.
6. When the farro is done, you can take it off the heat, add the zucchini mixture and combine.
7. Garnish with fresh parsley, green onions and serve.

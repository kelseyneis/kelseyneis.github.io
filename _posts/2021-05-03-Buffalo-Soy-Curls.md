### Method
1.	Empty the bag of soy curls into a large bowl and cover with water, let sit for 10 minutes.
2.	While they’re soaking, grab another large bowl and mix together corn starch, garlic powder, onion powder, and a few large turns of fresh pepper and set aside.
3.	In a small pot combine the buffalo sauce ingredients and heat over medium low heat, stirring often, until the butter melts, then off the heat.
4.	The soy curls should be ready now, drain the curls and pour them onto a kitchen towel, gently pat to remove excess water.
5.	Toss the soy curls in the cornstarch mixture until evenly covered.
6.	Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, spray with oil and sauté half of the soy curls for about 8 minutes until browned, place on a plate to the side and repeat with the other half. It’s important not to cook them all at once because they will steam instead of sear and you’ll get a more spongey texture.
7.	Once all of the curls are cooked rinse and dry one of the bowls you used earlier and pour about half of the buffalo sauce in, throw the soy curls in, and toss to combine. Pour the other half of the buffalo sauce on top and toss again to make sure all soy curls are coated evenly. I like to mix in the celery and sometimes carrots with the curls and buffalo sauce. Enjoy! :)

### Instructions 
1. Cook your pasta according to the directions on the package. Set aside.
2. Next, cook the broccoli. Preheat your oven to 400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss the broccoli florets with the oil and spices. Roast for about 15 minutes.
3. While the broccoli is cooking make your sauce. Add all sauce ingredients, except the non-dairy milk and tapioca starch into a small blender. Blend until smooth.
4. Add contents of the blender to a medium sauce pan. Turn heat to medium high.
5. In a small bowl, mix the milk and your tapioca starch with a fork. Immediately pour this into the sauce pan and whisk the entire mixture until smooth.
6. Allow the sauce to thicken, whisking often for about 5 minutes. If it gets too thick, add more liquid. Not thick enough? Add more tapioca starch (1 tsp at a time, whisking and waiting in between each addition).
7. Remove sauce from heat and stir in chopped spinach and pasta. If your pasta has been sitting for a while, you may want to splash it with some hot water before adding it to the sauce.
8. Stir in the broccoli and top with fresh basil and shaved almonds. Enjoy :)

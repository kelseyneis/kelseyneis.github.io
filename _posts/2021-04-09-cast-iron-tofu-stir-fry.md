- 2 tbs mirin
- 2 tbs (or tamari)
- 1 tbs agave syrup
- 2 tbs water

**Stir-Fry**
- Peanut oil 
- 14-16 oz tofu
- Salt
- Fresh black pepper
- 1 lb broccoli, cut into florettes, stems sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 1 small red onion, sliced into half moons

- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper 

**Garnish**

### Instructions 

1.	Press the tofu either with a tofu press the tried and true “cutting boards & books” method with a towel. You can also use previously frozen tofu; once thawed use a towel to soak up remaining water.
2.	Preheat the cast iron over medium-high heat. In the meantime, mix together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
3.	Have at the ready a baking pan or large mixing bowl to place the ingredients as they finish cooking. 
4.	Cook the tofu. Once pan is good and hot, apply a thin layer of olive oil. Add the tofu and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and fresh black pepper. Cook for about 7 minutes, tossing often and spraying with oil as necessary, until it’s nicely browned (not all sides need to be equally cooked. Transfer tofu to the baking ban or bowl.
5.	Cook the veggies. Apply a thin layer of oil, toss in onion and cook for 2 mins. Then add the broccoli and peppers. Add a pinch of salt and fresh black pepper. Cook until broccoli is charred and bright green, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the pan with the tofu.
6.	Time for the sauce. Add the garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes to the cast iron pan and drizzle with a little oil and sauté until fragrant (about a minute) being careful not to burn. Add the sauce and mix together until heated through and bubbly, about 2 minutes.
7.	Now, add back all the veggies and the tofu and toss to coat. Taste for salt and seasoning.
8.	Serve over quinoa or brown rice, top with avocado, peanut and basil and serve hot!

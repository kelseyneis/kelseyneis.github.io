2. Prepare pickled vegetables. Combine rice vinegar, water and ginger in a small pot. Bring to a boil and add red onion ajalapeño pepper. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. 
3. Make the coconut milk ranch dressing. Combine all dressing ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Store in the fridge until ready to serve.
4. Cook the garbanzo beans. Preheat the oven to 400F. Toss garbanzo beans with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, cumin and salt. Bake for 10-12 minutes; stir halfway through so they don’t burn. 
5. Satay red pepper and broccoli. While the chickpeas are cooking. Heat a medium pan with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced red pepper and broccolini and fry for 3-4 minutes until vegetables are slightly tender and bright in color.
6. Arrange plates. Spread rows of arugula or other greens, bell pepper, cucumber, garbanzo beans and Pickled Vegetables on plates. Serve with Coconut Milk Ranch or alternate dressing.

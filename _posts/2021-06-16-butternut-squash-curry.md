### Method
1. Cook the squash. Preheat oven to 400F. Cut both ends off the squash, peel it and cut in half lengthways. Cut squash into 1/2 inch cubes.
2. Place on a large baking tray, drizzle generously with oil salt and pepper, toss and place in the oven for 35-40 minutues until soft through and starting to brown on the edges.
3. Cook the rice or grains at this time, according to package instructions.
4. When the squash is almost done cooking, start the curry. Add coconut oil to a dutch oven or large pan on medium heat, once melted add finely chopped onion. Stir and fry for a few minutes then add crushed garlic. Let the onion and garlic cook for another minute.
5. Add all the spices. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant, add a little more oil if needed so it doesn't burn.
6. Add the tomatoes, coconut milk and vegetable stock. Bring to a gentle simmer and let cook for 10 minutes. 
7. Add the chickpeas and cook for 5 minutes, it should have thickened and be nice and creamy and orange in color. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If you like it spicy you can add some extra chilli powder.
8. Stir in the butternut squash and simmer for 5 or so minutes to let the squash absorb the sauce. Serve with rice or grains and top with cilantro. Enjoy :)

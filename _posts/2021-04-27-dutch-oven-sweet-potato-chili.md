### Method
1. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in your Dutch oven. Add onion and cook for a couple mins. Then add sweet potato, red pepper, carrots and celery. Cook for about 5 more minutes or until the onion and celery are soft, stirring often. 
2. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic and spices and stir well to combine.
3. Add vegetable broth, tomatoes with juices, beans and lime juice. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and cover to maintain a gentle simmer.
4. Simmer for about 45 minutes or until the sweet potatoes are tender. If you want thicker chili, use a potato masher to mash the chili while cooking (the sweet potatoes will cook more quickly too).
5. Garnish, serve, eat. Enjoy. :)

### Ingredients
- Potatoes 
  - 2 medium potatoes (about 10 ounces)
  - 2 teaspoons olive oil
  - Salt and pepper
- Tofu
  - 16 ounces tofu, firm 
  - ¾ tablespoon chili powder
  - ½ teaspoon garlic powder
  - ¼ teaspoon paprika
  - 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
  - 1 tablespoon lime juice (about a half lime)
- Scramble
  - 2 teaspoons olive oil
  - ½ white onion, diced
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 bell pepper, chopped
  - 1 cup brussels sprouts, shaved 
  - 8 ounces Chorizo Seitan
- Toppings
  - Shredded vegan cheese
  - Avocado
  - Salsa

### Instructions

1. First, cook your potatoes. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Chop potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes. Toss in olive oil, salt and pepper and spread on the baking sheet. Roast for 30-35 minutes, set aside.
2. Prepare the tofu. Slice tofu into 1-inch cubes (32 pieces) and place into a medium bowl. Add the remaining tofu ingredients and gently stir to coat (add the lime last). 
3. Cook the tofu. Add olive oil to large cast iron skillet and add the onion and garlic. Saute onion and garlic for 3 minutes, then add poblano peppers and saute for 3 more minutes. Add tofu and cook until browned and crispy. Use the other half of the lime to deglaze the pan, as needed.
4. Add tomato, kale, roasted potatoes, and chorizo and cook for 5-6 more minutes, or until the kale is tender. Add cheese and stir so it melts into the scramble.
5. Served topped with avocado, salsa, and jalapeno slices and hot sauce, if using.
